In this easy magic trick, you cause a toothpick that you�re holding in your hand to vanish in a flash. Some of these magic systems are accompanied by an intricate set of rules, while others rely more on mystery—we don’t always need to know how the magic works, just that it does. You�re the only one who responds to someone thinking out loud (literally). They can do things like change reality, cause nightmares, and plant ideas in people�s minds.
