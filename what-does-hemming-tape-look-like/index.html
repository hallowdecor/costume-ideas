Hemming tape�s adhesive is specially designed so that it doesn�t leave behind unwanted residue and doesn�t compromise the fabric on which it is applied. If you look really closely at your fabric, you will see tiny lines of fabric interlocking each other (if it’s a woven fabric). Also, seam binding ribbon is often delicate and sheer. It’s non woven fusible tape which has adhesive material on both sides and glues two layers of fabric together.

<p>It is frequently used to hem a garment when a perfectly flat hem is necessary, such as on a pair of cuffed slacks, or when the garment’s fabric is sufficiently fluid that a regular hem would be awkward at the bottom, but a rolled hem would not be suitable. This is because your fabric, after it is subjected to heat, is most likely to be foisted on with the melted hemming tape, and we know you surely don’t want that. A blind hem is a type of stitch that is done so that it prevents the fabric from unraveling, but isn’t visible from the “right” side of the fabric — the side you will be looking at.
