How to Tell the Difference Between Knit and Crochet Sew From sewhomey.com
Another reason for knowing the difference between woven and knit is because most factories work with one fabric or the other not both. Knitting is a process that involves intermeshing loops of yarns to manufacture fabrics. In the case of warp knitting, each loop in a horizontal direction is made from a different yarn and the number of yarn that is used for producing fabric is at least equal to the no. Examples are all woolen sweaters and hosiery garments that are stretchable • weaving involves intermeshing of two sets of yarns called warp ad weft and creating fabric out of them.
